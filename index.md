### What is SpikeInference?

`SpikeInference` is an `R` package for quantifying uncertainty (i.e., obtaining valid p-values and confidence intervals) for spikes estimated from calcium imaging data via the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ell_0"> penalized algorithm described in Jewell and Witten (2018) and Jewell et al. (2020). Details can be found in our manuscript (Chen et al. 2021).

### How do I install the package?

To download the SpikeInference package, use the code below.
``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yiqunchen/SpikeInference")
library(SpikeInference)
```
Note: `SpikeInference` imports the package `Rcpp`. If the installation process fails on MAC OS due to issues related to `R` and `cpp` compiler tools, this [post](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/) might provide some useful information.

### Why do we need SpikeInference?
Double-dipping &mdash; or more formally, generating a hypothesis based on your data, and then testing the hypothesis on that same data &mdash; renders classical hypothesis tests (e.g., z-test or Wilcoxon-rank for a difference-in-means; and in general any standard hypothesis tests) invalid, in the sense that Type I error is not controlled.

In the case of spike estimation on calcium imaging data, our goal is to test whether the estimated spikes are, in fact, associated with a true increase in calcium. However, the estimated spikes were obtained from the same data used for testing. Therefore, if we aren't careful, we will have a problem with double-dipping, and reject the null hypothesis too often.

As an example, we generate a time series of calcium imaging data according to a model with no spikes at all (see the leftmost figure below). The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ell_0"> algorithm estimated a spike at timepoint 1793. If we ignore the issue of double-dipping, and test the null hypothesis that there is no increase in calcium at timepoint 1793 using a Wald test, we get a  p-value <0.001. By contrast, our double-dippling-adjusted method yields a p-value of 0.24. Our result makes our sense here, since we simulated data with no true spikes. 

In fact, if we repeat this process for a bunch of times (~3,000 tests), we see that the Wald test leads to extremely *inflated Type I error* (see the middle figure below). By contrast, our selective test controls the Type I error at the nominal level (see the rightmost figure below).
