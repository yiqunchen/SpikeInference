### Overview
In this tutorial, we illustrate our framework for testing the hypothesis that the calcium is decaying exponentially (i.e., there is no true spikes) near spikes estimated via an $\ell_0$ penalized problem, as described in our manuscript. 

### Model setup
We consider the AR(1) generative model $$Y_t = c_t + \epsilon_t, \epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$
 where $$c_t = \gamma  c_{t-1} + z_t, z_t\geq 0$$. In words,
 this says that between spikes (when $z_t=0$), calcium decays exponentially at a (known) rate $\gamma\in(0,1)$. We denote the locations of true spikes, $\{t:z_t\geq 0\}$ as 
 $0 = \tau_0 < \tau_1 < \ldots < \tau_K < \tau_{K+1} = T$.

#### $\ell_0$ Spike estimation
We estimate spikes based on noisy observations $y_t, t = 1,  \ldots, T$ by solving the $\ell_0$ penalized optimization problem: 

 $$ \text{minimize}_{c_1,...,c_T\geq 0} \frac{1}{2}\sum_{t=1}^T ( y_t - c_t )^2 + \lambda \sum_{t=2}^T 
 1(c_t \neq \gamma c_t-1) .$$
 Estimated spikes correspond to the time t such that estimated calcium $\hat{c}_t$ does not decay exponentially, i.e.,
 $\{\hat{\tau}_1,\ldots,\hat{\tau}_j,\ldots\}  = \{t: \hat{c}_{t+1} -\gamma c_{t} \neq 0\}$

### Inference for the presence of spikes

To quantify the uncertainty of these estimates, we test the null hypothesis that there is no change in the exponentially decaying mean near an estimated spike. In particular, consider $j$th estimated spike location $\hat\tau_j$, under a simple assumption that there are no spikes within a window of $+h$ and $-h$ of $\hat\tau_j$, the null hypothesis we are interested in is equivalent to
 \begin{equation}
  H_0: \nu^\top c=0 \mbox{ versus } H_1: \nu^\top c > 0,
    \label{eq:null-nu}
  \end{equation}
  
where $$\nu_{t} = 
\begin{cases}
 0, & t \notin [\hat\tau_j-h+1, \hat\tau_j+h], \\
- \frac{\gamma (\gamma^2-1)}{\gamma^2-\gamma^{-2h+2}}    \gamma^{t-\hat\tau_j}    , & \hat\tau_j-h+1 \leq  t \leq \hat\tau_j, \\
\frac{\gamma^2 -1 }{\gamma^{2h}-1} \gamma^{t-(\hat\tau_j+1)}   , & \hat\tau_j + 1\leq t \leq \hat\tau_j+h.
\end{cases}$$

Intuitively, the larger the value of $h$ in defining the contrast vector $\nu$ in, the more data will be used to test the null hypothesis of interest, resulting in larger power. 


Now suppose that we test for the presence of a spike only at timepoints at which
1. we estimate a spike, 
2. there is an increase in fluorescence associated with this estimated spike. 

This motivates the following $p$-value: 
 $$\mathbb{P}_{H_0}\left(\nu^{\top} Y \geq \nu^{\top} y \;\middle\vert\; \hat\tau_j \in \mathcal{M}(Y) , \nu^{\top}Y > 0, \Pi_{\nu}^{\perp} Y= \Pi_{\nu}^{\perp} \right),$$
 where $\mathcal{M}(y)$ denote the set of estimated spikes from $y$ via the $\ell_0$ problem; and $\Pi_{\nu}^{\perp}$ is the orthogonal projection operator used to eliminate the nuisance parameter. We show in our manuscript that this p-value for testing $H_0$ can be written as
$$\mathbb{P}\left(\phi \geq \nu^\top y \middle|  \hat{\tau}_j \in \mathcal{M}(y'(\phi)), \phi\geq 0\right),$$
where $\phi\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2||\nu||_2^2)$, and  $$y'(\phi) = (I-\Pi_\nu)y+\phi\cdot \frac{\nu}{||\nu||_2^2} = y+\left(\frac{\phi-\nu^{\top}y}{||\nu||_2^2}\right)\nu$$ is a perturbation of the observed data $y$. 

Moreover, if we denote $\mathcal{S}=\{\phi: \hat\tau_j \in  \mathcal{M}(y'(\phi))\}$, then the p-value can be equivalently expressed as
$$\mathbb{P}\left(\phi \geq \nu^\top y \middle | \phi \in \mathcal{S}\cap(0,\infty)\right)$$. Now since $\phi\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2||\nu||_2^2)$, the $\phi |  \phi \in mathcal{S}\cap(0,\infty))$ will follow a truncated normal distribution, and the computation of the p-value boils down to characterizing the set $\mathcal{S}$.

Our software implements an efficient calculation of this $p$-value by analytically characterizing set $\mathcal{S}$; more details can be found in Sections 2 and 3 of our paper (Chen, Jewell, and Witten, 2021). 

Remark: by contrast, a naive (Wald) p-value would take the form
$$\mathbb{P}\left(\phi \geq \nu^\top y \right),$$
where the data-adaptive choice of hypothesis is not accounted for.

### Extensions
Our software also allows for the following extensions:

1. Generate $(1-\alpha)$ selective confidence intervals for the parameter $\nu^\top c$, the change in calcium associated with an estimated spike.
2. Compute valid p-values for the hypothesis $H_0: \nu^{\top} c \leq \delta \text{ versus } H_1: \nu^\top c > \delta$, where $\delta > 0$ is a user-specified parameter user can specify.
