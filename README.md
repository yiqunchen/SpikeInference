Quantifying uncertainty for spikes estimated from calcium imaging data

`SpikeInference` is an `R` package for quantifying uncertainty (i.e., obtaining valid p-values and confidence intervals) for spikes estimated from calcium imaging data via an <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ell_0"> penalized algorithm described in Jewell and Witten (2018) and Jewell et al. (2019).

## Installation

To download the SpikeInference package, use the code below.
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yiqunchen/SpikeInference")
library(SpikeInference)
```

Note that `SpikeInference` imports Rcpp. If the installation process fails on MAC OS due to issues on `R` compiler tools, this [post](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/) might provide a useful reference.

## Use

The vignette demonstrates example usage of all main functions. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/yiqunchen/SpikeInference/issues) if you have a request for a tutorial that is not currently included. You can see the vignette by using the following code (note that this requires a TeX installation to view properly):
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yiqunchen/SpikeInference", 
	build_vignette = TRUE, build_opts = c())

```

Note that R does not allow variable names to start with numbers. Sometimes, when going directly from QIIME2 to phyloseq objects, taxa names will be a large string starting with numbers. To clean these taxa names for use with corncob, use  `clean_taxa_names(my_phyloseq_object)`, see `?clean_taxa_names` for details.
